This is based upon the original flaskr tutorial:
    https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/

This tutorial creates a basic blog using the flask framework, but the style of the website has been
adjusted to make it more responsive.   It is possible to adjust the code and upload it to a cloud
platform such as google cloud, but I do not really want to be responsible for administering the 
comments on the site.

Tests are created using pytest.
